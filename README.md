# time_series_smooth
Unique formulation of Exponential Smoothing forecasting used for computing system congestion management.
## Background
Siemens filed for exclusive rights to this technique for telecom products in 2003 and obtained US patent [US7301903B2](https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=07301903&IDKey=919E975B320C&HomeUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2FnphParser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D7301903.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F7301903%2526RS%3DPN%2F7301903) in 2007 with this author, an employee at the time of the filing, the sole inventor. The computer program contained in the src dircetory, time_series_smooth.c, implements the integer math and forecast reset functionality described in the companion paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08123.
